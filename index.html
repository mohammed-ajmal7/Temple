          <P>A temple (from the Latin templum) is a building reserved for spiritual rituals and activities such as
            prayer and sacrifice. Religions which erect temples include Christianity (whose temples are typically called
            churches), Hinduism (whose temples are called Mandir or Kovil), Buddhism, Sikhism (whose temples are called
            gurudwara), Jainism (whose temples are sometimes called derasar), Islam (whose temples are called mosques),
            Judaism (whose temples are called synagogues), Zoroastrianism (whose temples are sometimes called Agiary),
            the Baha'i Faith (which are often simply referred to as Baha'i House of Worship), Taoism (which are
            sometimes called Daoguan), Shinto (which are sometimes called Jinja), Confucianism (which are sometimes
            called the Temple of Confucius), and ancient religions such as the Ancient Egyptian religion and the Ancient
            Greek religion.

            The form and function of temples are thus very variable, though they are often considered by believers to
            be, in some sense, the "house" of one or more deities. Typically, offerings of some sort are made to the
            deity, and other rituals are enacted, and a special group of clergy maintain and operate the temple. The
            degree to which the whole population of believers can access the building varies significantly; often parts,
            or even the whole main building, can only be accessed by the clergy. Temples typically have a main building
            and a larger precinct, which may contain many other buildings or may be a dome-shaped structure, much like
            an igloo.</P>
